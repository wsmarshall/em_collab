The main repository for a collaborative research project on graph embeddings.

In particular, investigating part of the Earth-Moon problem (a variant of the Four-Color Map Theorem).

Uses the PySAT library through an "intermediary" of Jupyter Notebooks to investigate the
decomposability of candidate graphs into triangular biembeddings, among other things.
